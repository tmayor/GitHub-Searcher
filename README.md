# GitHub-Searcher
The Github searcher, allows you to find anyone on who is a registered github user, view their profile, find their lastest respository. Its allows you to easily search for anyone who is on github easily. I made use of the Github API to be able to have access to the data. It was built with Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. And Liittle bit of Boostrap4 included.
